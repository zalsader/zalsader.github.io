I recently updated my website to use [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme. It is simple to use and looks minimally beautiful. The native dark theme is a good bonus. I am hosting this on Github pages behind Cloudflare. I will keep playing around with this over the next while. The theme includes the ability to write blog posts, which I will probably use for random tech things or whatever projects I am working on. Still figuring things out as I go.
